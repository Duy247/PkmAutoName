Pokecord auto namer with auto clipboard
Story behind:
    Hello, I am a beginner in coding.
    So I was playing Pokecord on Discord when I read about how many people use Discord's OAuth2 to make self-bots to catch Pokémon quickly and automatically. However, this is forbidden and against the bot's terms of service. So, I came up with the idea to manually catch Pokémon at high speed (perhaps not lightning speed, but at the speed of sound). I then decided to implement my idea into a simple Visual Basic program that would be sufficient while also maintaining its simplicity.

Features:
   - Automatically gets the Pokemon's name into clipboard after you copy the link of the pokemon's picture that Pokecord provided.
   - It runss in background with a circle of 0.1s, so you can keep using it to get as much name as you want, just need to paste using Ctrl+V and you get the name.
   - Buttons lead to the pokemon database page of your chosen pokemon.
   - Evolution information of your chosen pokemon, keep in mind that the information is the actual evolution path within Pokecord, not any of the pokemon games.
   - A profile picture of my Discord.
   - Low size, low usage, because it is simple C#.
    
How to use: 
   
   Just right-click the pokemon pictures that Pokecord provided, and you get all the info you want in the program, especially having the name of the Pokemon copied into clipboard.

Because I coded it in Visual Basic, so it triggers some false-positive anti-malware and anti-virus, for example the Window Security itself. So I just leave the VirusTotal [here](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/c7c6e32b160cc3ad9feab62ecdd38043da08eeb61b2e178de23937f4414ccc06?nocache=1)

Because I am a beginner, I don't know how to get through this, so...
